## DESINV23 Project 2 ##

This repository holds the code for SFaucet; it's meant to be a way to quickly and easily categorize my most commonly listened to songs. 

Future Work:
- Adding sync with my actual Spotify Account
- Comparing entered songs against my music to triangulate best fit music. 

Note:
- You can totally use this yourself! Just replace allsongs.csv with your own music file (I used Exportify to get them: https://exportify.net/)
- Fill out a .env file with a CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET from Spotify's web API.
